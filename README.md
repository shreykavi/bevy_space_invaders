Playground for me to tinker with Bevy (Rust based game framework)

Note that this does require Vulkan to utilize GPU 
(WSL2 users may have problems and require additional setup)

Space Invaders Tutorials from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yb3vInxzKGE

Note that the compilation is under `/docs` to workaround GitHub Pages hosting.
